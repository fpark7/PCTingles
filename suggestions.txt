Suggestions from Milestone 1:
	Shorten/make the about us page less wall of text
		-fixed by adding photo. (not a lot of text anyways)
	Add a back to top dynamic button
		-tricky js. should we make the button floating?
	Think about 2 other functionalities for Milestone 5 (Business Plan - what do we offer?)
		
	Added functionality can be like the contact us page for the 24/7 support

Other Additions?:
	Are users making an account? Ask for password?
